The Dataset for Histopathological images is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images

The Dataset for Colonoscopy images is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images

and also https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=colon+cancer with the help of this link you can find various types of datasets for colon cancer

Important: To run the ResNet model you need to open the train_retinanet.py file, copy and paste the Jupyter notebook then run the model
